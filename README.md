# 📌 San Diego Traffic Stop Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes 383,027 traffic stop records from San Diego (2013–2017) to uncover trends related to arrests, race, age, violations, and day-of-week traffic behavior. The analysis includes visualization, hypothesis testing, correlation heatmap, and a regression prediction model.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw data
- Explore demographic and behavioral traffic patterns
- Test statistical hypotheses
- Build a linear regression model to predict arrests
- Visualize trends clearly for decision support

## 📈 Highlights / Findings
- Sunday has the lowest traffic stops; weekday stops are higher
- Males are stopped more than females
- Hispanic & White distributions show stronger variations
- Younger drivers experience more arrests
- Regression model explains ~32% of arrest variance
- Predicted arrests reasonably match real values

## 📂 Files Included
- Final R code 2.R → full R analysis script
- Final Project-Milestone 4_Thongrakard.pdf → professional written report with charts & interpretation
